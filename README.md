## 🎯 Why This Repo Exists
This repo makes my **invisible developer contributions** visible — offering clear proof of progress, discipline, and domain competence to collaborators, mentors, or employers.

The code may be private—but **growth, discipline, and vision remain visible.**

> “Effort is hidden, but its impact echoes.
System building is more than code — it’s consistency, context, and contribution.”
